# Rally Analytics #

Some of the examples in the https://github.com/RallyCommunity/RallyAnalytics require JQuery and Highcharts libraries to function correctly.  As of June 1, 2016, these dependencies will no longer be hosted / provided by CA Technologies.  

Potential options include hosting these libraries yourself or using community hosted versions (ex. https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js, http://code.highcharts.com/2.1.6/modules/exporting.js).

Note, to run the examples in here, you'll need to launch Chrome with the following:

On Mac

`cd /Applications`
`open Google\ Chrome.app --args --disable-web-security --allow-file-access-from-files --allow-cross-origin-auth-prompt`
    
On Windows

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --disable-web-security --allow-file-access-from-files --allow-cross-origin-auth-prompt`

This project makes it easier to get data from Rally's Lookback API endpoints. It serves as both a REST Toolkit for node.js access, 
as well as a data access library for running inside of a browser. However, the preferred way to access it in the browser is
to use Rally's App SDK 2.0.

## Concepts ##

In order for you to be productive using the Rally Lookback API, there are two things you'll need to wrap your head around:

1. The temporal snapshot data model
2. The MongoDB-like query language

**Snapshot Data Model**

The data model for the repository that sits under this API has been carefully crafted for efficient analytics. It is particularly 
well suited to seeing how your data changes over time which is the focus of most reports (burn charts, defect trend, cumulative flow, etc.). 
The data is stored in a snapshot schema which means that every time there is a change, an entirely new snapshot of the effected entity is 
saved with the new values (as well as the previous ones). The older snapshot is not removed. It is only updated to adjust its _ValidTo timestamp. 

Let's say you have this:

    {
      _id: 'B2E...',  # GUID just for analytics engine
      ObjectID: 777,  # objectID (OID) from Rally
      Name: "Footer disappears when using new menu",
      State: "Submitted",
      _ValidFrom: "2011-01-01T12:34:56Z",
      _ValidTo: "9999-01-01T00:00:00Z",  # "current" snapshot
      OtherField: 'Other Value'  # ... Other fields not shown
    }

Then on January 2, 2011, at noon GMT, the analytics engine receives a notice that Rally object 777 had its "State" field changed from "Submitted" 
to "Open". The latest record for rally object 777 is read. Its _ValidTo is updated but nothing else is changed in that record. Rather, a new record 
is created showing the new value as well as the previous values for the field(s) that changed. So, the repository would now contain the updated 
original plus the new snapshot like so:

    {
      _id: 'B2E...',  # GUID just for analytics engine
      ObjectID: 777,  # objectID (OID) from Rally
      Name: "Footer disappears when using new menu",
      State: "Submitted",
      _ValidFrom: "2011-01-01T12:34:56Z",  
      _ValidTo: "2011-01-02T12:00:00Z",  # updated
      OtherField: 'Other Value'  # ... Other fields not shown
    }

    {
      _id: 'A37...',  # a new analytics "document" so it gets a new _id
      ObjectID: 777,  # same Rally OID
      Name: "Footer disappears when using new menu",
      State: "Open",
      _ValidFrom: "2011-01-02:12:00:00Z",  # equals B2Eâ€™s _ValidTo
      _ValidTo: "9999-01-01T00:00:00Z",    
      _PreviousValues: {
        State: "Submitted"
      },
      OtherField: 'Other Value'  # ... Other fields not shown
    }

Things to note:

* Every time there is a change, an entirely new snapshot of the effected entity is saved with the new values (as well as the unchanged ones).  
* The _PreviousValues field stores the values that were replaced when this particular snapshot was added.
* The way _ValidFrom and _ValidTo are manipulated, you can rely upon the property that for a given Rally ObjectID, only one version of the object 
  will be active for any moment in time.
* Null ("No Entry") values are not stored except...
* There is a special case where a value is changed from null to a non-null value. In this case, the _PreviousValues field will explicitly say 
  that it was null before the change.
  
**The Query Language**

The query language understood by Rally's Analytics API, is based upon the [MongoDB query language](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries).
You string together a number of clauses to pull back the "documents" of interest. This API supports the following operators.

* `{a: 10}` - docs where a is 10 or an array containing the value 10
* `{a: 10, b: "hello"}` - docs where a is 10 and b is "hello"
* `{a: {$gt: 10}}` - docs where a > 10, also $lt, $gte, and $lte   
* `{a: {$ne: 10}}` - docs where a != 10 
* `{a: {$in: [10, "hello"]}}` - docs where a is either 10 or "hello"
* `{a: {$exists: true}}` - docs containing an "a" field
* `{a: {$exists: false}}` - docs not containing an "a" field
* `{a: {$type: 2}}` - docs where a is a string (see bsonspec.org for more types)
* `{a: /foo.*bar/}` - docs where a matches the regular expression "foo.*bar"
* `{"a.b": 10}` - docs where a is an embedded document where b is 10
* `{$or: [{a: 1}, {b: 2}]}` - docs where a is 1 or b is 2
* `{$and: [{a: 1}, {b: 2}]}` - docs where a is 1 and b is 2

## Usage ##

More usage examples are provided in the API Documentation for each Class/Method but here is a quick walkthrough of a common usage.

First, you need to "require" the desired analytics query class(es). We're also going to require a mock
for the XMLHttpResponse Object but you can simply omit it for your own use.

    rally_analytics = require('../')
    {GuidedAnalyticsQuery} = rally_analytics
    {XHRMock} = rally_analytics  # Not required for normal use. Only for "testing"

Then, you need to set the config Object.

    config =
      'X-RallyIntegrationName': 'My Chart'
      'X-RallyIntegrationVendor': 'My Company'
      'X-RallyIntegrationVersion': '0.1.0'
      workspaceOID: 12345  # if running in Node.js will look for RALLY_WORKSPACE environment variable
      
Now you are ready to instantiate your analytics query.
      
    query = new GuidedAnalyticsQuery(config)  # You would use XMLHttpRequest
    query.XHRClass = XHRMock  # Omit to hit real Rally Analytics API
    
And, specify query clauses.

    query.type('HierarchicalRequirement')
         .scope('_ProjectHierarchy', 1234)
         .leafOnly()
         .additionalCriteria({Blocked: true})
    
Next, specify a callback.

    callback = () ->
      console.log(this.allResults.length)  # will spit back 5 from our XHRMock
    # 5

Finally, call getAll()

    query.getAll(callback)
    
## Development ##

To use the test and build tools for this library, you are going to need a few things.

1. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download). Contrary to popular impression, Node.js is not only a server 
   technology. We use it to run JavaScript/CoffeeScript on the desktop just like you can run Ruby or Java
   on the desktop.
2. Once Node.js is installed, you should be able to run a few node package manager (npm) commands to install necessary
   dependant modules.
        
        npm install

   Will install the package dependencies listed in package.json, locally.

        sudo npm -g install coffee-script
        sudo npm -g install coffeedoc-lm
        sudo npm -g install coffeedoctest
        sudo npm -g install nodeunit
        sudo npm -g install jitter (optional if you want auto compilation)
        sudo npm -g install uglify-js
        sudo npm -g install browserify
        sudo npm -g install xmlhttprequest

   Will install them globally.  You can choose to do either.
        
3. Add the following to your ~/.profile (or equivalent) file. Note, nodeunit will not work without the NODE_PATH.
        
        RALLY_SERVER=rally1.rallydev.com; export RALLY_SERVER
        RALLY_USER=mylogin@mycompany.com; export RALLY_USER
        RALLY_PASSWORD=xxxxx; export RALLY_PASSWORD
        RALLY_WORKSPACE=12345; export RALLY_WORKSPACE
        RALLY_PROJECT=67890; export RALLY_PROJECT

   Also, if you've installed package dependences locally, add the following:

        NODE_PATH=./node_modules; export NODE_PATH
        PATH=./node_modules/.bin:./bin:$PATH

   And if globally:

        NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules; export NODE_PATH
        PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules/.bin:./bin:$PATH
        
   After edit, restart your session or use command `source ~/.profile` to activate the changes immediately.

## Evolving this data access library and these examples ##

To upgrade the capabilities of the data access tools, you should do the following:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make your code changes.
3. Write tests and confirm their successful operation with `cake test`.
4. Upgrade the documentation and make sure the examples in it are accurate by running `cake docs`,
   which depends upon [CoffeeDocTest](https://github.com/lmaccherone/coffeedoctest). Note, this will
   generate documentation from the here-comments in the source code.
   If you want to publish the documentation to your own account, you can also run `cake pub-docs`.
5. Submit a pull request which will tell us about your changes.

If you want to build upon one of the examples to make your own App, then we recommend that you
follow the process above, except that you should rename the repository after you fork it. Alternatively,
you could add the data access code from this repository to a larger project repository and go from there.
In either case, send us an email at [app-submission@rallydev.com](mailto:app-submission@rallydev.com)
telling us about your new App.
